Hi, My name is Dennis Riis, and I do software for a living. I am currently employed at eBay Classifieds, in Århus, Dennmark, where I am the lead architect - technically responsible for the technology, quality and code for the 3 main platforms offered by eBay in Denmark: [DBA](https://www.dba.dk), [Bilbasen](https://www.bilbasen.dk) and [BilInfo](https://www.bilinfo.net). 


I started my stint at eBay as a Backend Engineer, coming from a similar role at the e-commerce agency Impact. Through my years at eBay I have held many different roles within different platform: Backend Engineer, Mobile Developer (iOS), Technical Lead, Lead Architect.

At work, we are currently transitioning from large monolithic platforms towards microservices and cloud; and from .NET Framework towards .NET Core. My skills include:

* Large scale software architecture
* Distributed software design
* Technical leader
* Software development in general - I make a point of actually doing coding work each and every weeek. Both because I like it and it brings me joy, but also because you can never truly be a software architect if you are not intimate with the actual problems developers will hit with your design.

My list of technologies of choice change over time, but currently it is

* C#
* .NET Core 
* Docker 
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Elastic Search

I am a Computer Science Engineer. I graduated from Ingeniørhøjskolen i Århus in january 2006. Other than general programming and algorithms, I also followed courses about embedded programming, communication theory, amongst many others. 

I live in a small town called Farre, just south of the city Hammel. We live in a 70'es house, which we bought in 2011, with my wife and our 2 boys aged 6 and 4. Along with a couple of cats. I tend to have a programming "pet project" going at home. I was born in 1981. When not programming or otherwise working at the computer, these are my other hobbies:

* Spending time with the family
* Riding my motorcycle
* Wood working / building stuff 
* Running, cycling and other exercise
