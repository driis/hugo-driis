		<p>After deciding to get this blog, I needed to find some software to run it on. I briefly considered writing it myself, but decided that it would be too much effort, and that I probably never would be able to finish it, considering work and other projects. </p>
<p>So I started hunting around for some open source blogging software, and after an hour of googling, I decided on <a title="BlogEngine.NET" href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/" target="_blank">BlogEngine.NET</a>. My main considerations where that it needed to be open source .NET (so I can fix stuff if it breaks), highly customizable and easy to extend. It was also important that it would work without a database, since my current web host only provides access to a sluggish and unreliable MySQL server (but hey, it's cheap ;-) </p>
<p>I also considered <a title="dasBlog" href="http://www.dasblog.info/" target="_blank">dasBlog</a>, but <a title="BlogEngine.NET" href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/" target="_blank">BlogEngine.NET</a> seemed simpler and more suitable for my simple needs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Setting stuff up was simpler than expected.&nbsp; <a title="BlogEngine.NET" href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/" target="_blank">BlogEngine.NET</a> target audience is developers, according to their web page, so I was prepared to be hand-editing a myriad of obscure configuration files - But after downloading the source and creating a virtual directory on my local machine for the application, it just ran. I actually started editing the settings.xml file before I found out that a UI was provided for it. So i customized some settings, and did a bit of changes to one of the default templates, before I was ready to go online. I actually think that setting it up for debugging in Visual Studio took longer than the actual customizations (My home machine runs Vista, and I had some problems with ASP .NET and IIS7, which I was able to resolve by using the "Classic ASP.NET pipelining" mode). </p>
<p>I downloaded the source, so that I could try to compile it for myself and poke a bit around, before ultimately deciding to base my blog on this application. I haven't spent too much time looking at the code, but it seems to be well designed and thought-through. </p>
<p>Anyways, uploading the site via FTP to my web host was no problem. I used Visual Studio to make a precompiled copy of the web site first. </p>
<p>Setting up the blog, customizing it and publishing it took less than 2 hours. I did not get stuck at all, and everything behaved as expected; overall it was a nice experience. So thumbs up to the <a title="BlogEngine.NET" href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/" target="_blank">BlogEngine.NET</a> developers ! </p>
