<p>So, I decided today that I needed a blog. So here it is, me blogging about programming in general, .NET and my everyday experiences.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Why does the world need another blog; you might ask ? Well, it is an experiment for now. I will try to provide some interesting content - and at the same time it will be a place for me to document various findings and thoughts. Anyways, it is much better than the old "Web 0.1" static content website that I used to have on this domain ;-) </p>
<p>I encourage everyone to use the comments for questions and/or suggestions.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Don't know who I am ?&nbsp;</strong> </p>
<p>Well, you don't really need to, in order to read my posts. My name is Dennis Riis and I am a danish software developer / architect, currently working with web technologies. If you want to read more about me, you can always head over to the <a href="/">About me page</a>.</p></div>
