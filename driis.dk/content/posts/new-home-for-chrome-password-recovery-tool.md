In 2008, I created the [Chrome Password Recovery Tool][2]. However, the download links on that page have been lost in a server migration. 

Since I have been getting some email about the absence of a download of the tool, I decided to release it as open source on CodePlex. So [go get it from here][1], if you need it.

This latest version supports the latest Chrome version (10), and enables reading the passwords while Chrome is running.
