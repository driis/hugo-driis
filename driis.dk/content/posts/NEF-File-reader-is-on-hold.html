I&nbsp;have not had very much time to blog nor work on my NEF file reader project for a while. It has been turbulent and busy times at work, lately. 
<p>This post is just to let you know, that the project is curently on hold. Perhaps I will resume it later, when I have more free time at hand. If anyone is interested in a peek at the source code as it looks now (incomplete and raw), please let me know; and I can mail it to you. There is not too much functionality, however. The largest obstacle in getting further with the project, is the need to decode the Huffman-encoded sample bit lengths embedded in the file - I have not resolved this yet. </p>
