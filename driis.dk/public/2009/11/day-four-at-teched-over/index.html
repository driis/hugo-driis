        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">I started the day with a session on C# 4.0 Dynamic: The why’s and hows. It was being done by Alex Turner, who is Program Manager for the C# compiler. This was a very interesting walk through why C# should have dynamic features, and why it has been designed as it is. There has gone a lot of design thought into the dynamic design, and I certainly think that the final design they’ve chosen is the right one. He demoed creating your own dynamic types from C# which can respond to any method call – very cool. I can certainly see some good use cases for the C# <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">dynamic</i> keyword. <p></p></span>

        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">Next, I went to see a talk about Windows Communication Foundation: Developer’s Guide to Windows Communication Foundation, SOA and success. Interesting, and with some very good thoughts on interoperability. My most important take-away from that session, is that if you need to be interoperable, try to do REST. <p></p></span>

        <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Calibri">In the afternoon, I went to see Tess Ferrandez present on ASP .NET post-mortem debugging (well, the techniques apply to any .NET process, I think, but it was presented towards ASP .NET). This is the kind of debugging you get to do when your process consumes too much memory, hangs, or explodes; in the production environment, without you being able to reproduce the issue locally. When this kind of debugging is needed, something is on fire, and you will get stress fixing it. But apart from that, I do find this kind of debugging challenging and kind-of-fun ;-) Tess demonstrated using WinDbg, SOS.dll (Son-of-Strike, someone please explain the name to me), Debug Diag and other tools. She demonstrated detecting a memory issue, a poor performance issue, and a crash issue using these tools. She also demonstrated doing these using Visual Studio 2010, with its new ability to open memory dumps, and do debugging on them. With this cool new feature, you can do almost everything you can do in a normal debug session, but in a memory dump, that you might have obtained from some production server. You can see the stack trace, the locals, and examine the value of objects. The only thing you cannot do, is run/step back/forward, of course, the dump is an image of the process at a specific time. Very neat is the Parallel Stacks feature, where Visual Studio will visualize the stack of each thread for you, which makes it easy to identify contention in your locking, as well as other thread sync issues. <p></p></span>
