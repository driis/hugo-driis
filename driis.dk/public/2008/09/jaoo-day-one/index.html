		<p>Today, I've been attending the first day at the JAOO Conference. It has been an interesting day, and I am amazed by all the very talented people that speaks here at the conference, as well as by the quality of the talks. I have been attending these sessions:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Opening Keynote: Where Are Programming Languages Going, by Anders Hejlsberg</strong>
      <br />In this talk, Anders presented his take on how the programming languages will be evolving in the future. One point made, was that programming languages has not evolved much over the last 25 years - which was exemplified by a "Hello world" program in Pascal versus one in C#. The C# one was neither the shortest nor the most concise one. Anders believes that we will se more implementation of what he calls "internal domain-specific-languages", such as LINQ. Furthermore, he thinks that in the future the gap between functional and imperative programming languages will diminish, since they are already today starting to borrow the best elements from each other. Finally, he talked about concurrency and in-language concurrency constructs such as isolation, which Anders predicts also will be part of the main-stream languages in the near future. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Continuous Integration<br /></strong>
The Continuous Integration talk was a great introduction to me into Continuous integration, since it is something, that I have little to zero experience with. We do have a build server that does nightly builds at work, but as Chris Read, the speaker, pointed out, that is not CI, though it is a step on the way toward succesful CI.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Google Chrome: The Invisible Browser</strong><br />
This was a talk by Ben Goodger, the Google Chrome UI tech lead, about the minimalist Chrome UI and the architecture and decisions behind it. It was interesting, though there was not much new to learn here. (Or perhaps I should know better than to attend UI talks, when UI does not really interest me. I am trying to learn ;-) )
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>LING and C# 3.0</strong><br />
This was the second talk by Anders Hejlsberg this day, and featured the new features in C# 3.0. This was info that I knew (mostly) in advance, but Anders explained both the how and the why behind the features - which was really interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>PowerShell</strong><br />
The talk about PowerShell was really good; even for me who know and use PowerShell in advance. It got beyond the covers on why the architecture and implementation works as it does, which was interesting and enlightening, and I left with a better understanding of PowerShell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Scala Programming Language</strong><br />
Scala is a language for the JVM, that I did not know much about in advance. The talk was interesting, but in "real life", I am probably never going to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why Functional Programming (still) Matters</strong><br />
This talk by Erik Meijer was propably the most interesting and entertaining one on Day One of JAOO. With enthusiasm, Erik explained about side-effects and why they are bad and what one should do about them (make them explicit if they cannot be avoided). He also demonstrated a few side effects, that can hit you in C# or other main stream languages with closures and lambdas, which was a pleasant reminder for me.
