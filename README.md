# hugo-driis
My [personal website, driis.dk](https://www.driis.dk) as a hugo static content site 

This was converted from a legacy homegrown solution into Hugo in 2020 (not yet published live anywhere)

Directory structure:
* legacy: A json dump of the legacy data and a small .NET Core console program to convert it into Hugo format
* driis.dk: The Hugo version of [driis.dk](https://www.driis.dk)
